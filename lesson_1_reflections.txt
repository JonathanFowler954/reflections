How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	I've never used Diff before this lesson. I found the ease of finding the difference between the files simple to spot and this will be a useful addition to my tool belt moving forward.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	Having easy access to previous version can help assist us in recovering a version that previously worked, removing changes that broke the "current" version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	They were designed for different purposes. Git was developed for codebases while the others were more focused on business type files which are singularly crafted.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	You can use git log to list all commits within the git version control system. Then use git diff to determine the differences between both versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	With a fail-safe/back stop to the changes that we are making you can continue to make changes without worrying about breaking the entire project.
